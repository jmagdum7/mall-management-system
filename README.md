Explanation/ Scope:

Each department consists of various stores and a Store Manager manages proceedings of his/her store. The last employee in the privilege chain is the Sales Clerk for handling products in the store.
3. Central administrator has the control on all the activities, w.r.t. adding, deleting, modifying database information and accessing the daily sales in the Mall.
4. Each Employee has their own login. The Administrator, Manager and Employees will be guided to different functionalities based on their individual logins.
5. Each new order accepts the Customer information, along with details of the products and the details of the store to which the product belongs.
6. A Customer is entitled to discounts on the total price of his product based on current offers. A final price for each product is generated from the database which is calculated based on the discount and quantity of products purchased.
7. An Invoice is generated in pdf format for each order highlighting all the important details of the order such as the employee who has billed the order, the details of the products purchased and the customer contact details along with a unique invoice number.
